                <h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>
                <p>
                    No Country for Old Men is a 2005 novel by American author Cormac McCarthy, who had originally
                    written the story as a screenplay. The story occurs in the vicinity of the Mexicoâ€“United States
                    border in 1980 and concerns an illegal drug deal gone wrong in the Texas desert back country. Owing
                    to its origins as a screenplay, the novel has a simple writing style that differs from McCarthy's
                    earlier novels. The book was adapted into a 2007 Coen brothers film of the same name, which won four
                    Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

                    <h3>The Odyssey</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Odyssey is one of two major epic poems of ancient Greek literature attributed to Homer. It
                        is one of the oldest surviving works of literature and remains popular with modern audiences.
                        Like the Iliad, the Odyssey is divided into 24 books. It follows the Greek hero and king of
                        Ithaca, Odysseus, and his homecoming journey after the ten-year long Trojan War. His journey
                        from Troy to Ithaca lasts an additional ten years, during which time he encounters many perils
                        and all of his crewmates are killed. In Odysseus' long absence, he is presumed dead, leaving his
                        wife Penelope and son Telemachus to contend with a group of unruly suitors competing for
                        Penelope's hand in marriage.

                        <h3>House of leaves</h3>
                        <p>
                            House of Leaves is the debut novel by American author Mark Z. Danielewski, published in
                            March 2000 by Pantheon Books. A bestseller, it has been translated into a number of
                            languages, and is followed by a companion piece, The Whalestoe Letters. The novel is written
                            as a work of epistolary fiction and metafiction focusing on a fictional documentary film
                            titled The Navidson Record, presented as a story within a story discussed in a handwritten
                            monograph recovered by the primary narrator, Johnny Truant. The narrative makes heavy use of
                            multiperspectivity as Truant's footnotes chronicle his efforts to transcribe the manuscript,
                            which itself reveals The Navidson Record's supposed narrative through transcriptions and
                            analysis depicting a story of a family who discovers a larger-on-the-inside labyrinth in
                            their house.
