            <em><strong>Why I am Interested in Horror</strong></em>
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            My parents are divorced and I visit my dad over the summer. During this time we watch a lot of horror movies
            since that is somethign he really enjoys and wanted to share with me. I then have picked it up as an
            interest of my own.

            <em><strong>My Future Goals</strong></em>
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            I have two dreams, the first of which is to graduate from college and get a job as a forencist. This job is
            appealing to me as I get to work by myself a lot and I am not a person to shy away from blood. My secpnd
            dream is to have one of the games I have designed get picked up by a company and make it official.
