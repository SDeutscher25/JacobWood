            <h3>10 chicken drumsticks</h3>

            <h3>1 habanero pepper, seeded and halved</h3>

            <h3>1/4 cup rice vinegar</h3>

            <h3>1/3 cup soy sauce</h3>

            <h3>1/2 cup honey</h3>

            <h3>1 teaspoon garlic powder</h3>

            <h3>1 teaspoon onion powder</h3>

            <h3>1/2 teaspoon hot chili flakes</h3>

            <h3>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</h3>

            <h3>1 1/2 teaspoons Korean chili paste (gochujang)</h3>

            <h3>2 tablespoons snipped fresh chives (optional)</h3>

            <h1>Instructions</h1>
            <h3>1. Transfer chicken drumsticks into a resealable plastic bag placed over a bowl.</h3>
            <h3>
                2. Add habanero pepper, rice vinegar, and soy sauce to a blender or blender cup, and blend on high for
                about 30 seconds. Transfer into a bowl.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                3. Add honey, garlic powder, onion powder, chili flakes, cayenne, and chili paste to the bowl and whisk
                until evenly combined.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                4. Pour marinade into the bag with chicken, and carefully massage the outside of the bag until
                drumsticks are evenly coated. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag tightly.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                4.Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 10 hours for best results. (If necessary,
                chicken can be cooked immediately, but drumsticks will be more flavorful if marinated for a few hours.)
            </h3>
            <h3>
                5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer chicken and marinade into a casserole
                dish, and space drumsticks evenly into a single layer.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                6. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes; remove from the oven and turn chicken pieces over.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                7. Continue to bake drumsticks until meat is very tender and beginning to brown, about 45 minutes more;
                turn or baste drumsticks every 15 minutes.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                8. Remove drumsticks to a serving platter and cover loosely with foil. Carefully pour all the liquids
                from the roasting dish into a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook sauce until it
                starts to thicken slightly, about 3 minutes.
            </h3>
            <h3>9. Spoon sauce over drumsticks. Scatter freshly snipped chives over chicken to serve.</h3>
