        <h1>Halloween</h1>
        <hr />
    <p>Halloween, a holiday observed on October 31 and noted for its pagan and religious roots and secular traditions. 
        In much of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is largely nonreligious, celebrated with parties, spooky costumes, jack-o’-lanterns, pumpkin carvings, and the giving of candy. 
        But the holiday also marks the beginning of Allhallotide, a three-day Christian triduum dedicated to remembering the dead that begins with Halloween (October 31) and is followed by All Saints’ Day (November 1)
        and All Souls’ Day (November 2).</p>
        
    <p>Halloween, or Hallowe'en (less commonly known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve,
         or All Saints' Eve), is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. 
        It is at the beginning of the observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), 
        martyrs, and all the faithful departed. In popular culture, 
        the day has become a celebration of horror and is associated with the macabre and the supernatural.</p>
