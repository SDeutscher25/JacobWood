      <mark>In the United States, public holidays are set by federal, state, and local governments and are often observed by
      closing government offices or giving government employees paid time off. The federal government does not require
      any private business to close or offer paid time off, as is the case for most state local governments, so
        employers determine which holidays to observe.</mark>
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;">
      <mark>Several federal holidays are widely observed by private businesses with paid time off. These include New Year's
      Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Businesses often close or grant paid
      time off for New Year's Eve, Christmas Eve, and the Day after Thanksgiving, but none of these are federal
      holidays. Other federal holidays are less widely observed by business. Most federal holidays are regularly
      celebrated on a Monday or Friday to create a three-day weekend.</mark>
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;">
      <mark>Christmas is the only religious holiday that is a federal holiday. Some businesses allow employees of
      non-Christian Religions to take paid time off for their religious observances.</mark>
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;">
      <mark>Other holidays, such as Halloween and Valentine's Day, are widely celebrated in the United States but rarely
      include paid time off</mark>
