      <h1>Venom</h1>

      <p>
        Venom is a former villain of Spider-man turned hero. He was first published as a villain to Spider Man, a
        symbiote from his black suit which he gained during the Secrets Wars. Venom became an "anti-hero" in his own
        comics "Venom: Lethal Protector"
      </p>

      <p>
        Venom is an alien species known as symbiotes. His origins stem from Spider man's black suit but continued far
        past. He bonded with a rival photagrapher to Peter Parker, Eddie Brock. He and Eddie joined forces to kill
        spider due to their shared hatred for him. Venom has had many hosts over the years including but not limited to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Flash thompson</li>
        <li>Rick Jones</li>
        <li>Mac Gargan</li>
        <li>Harry osborn</li>
        <li>Peter Parker</li>
        <li>Angelo Fortunato</li>
        <li>Dylan Brock</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Venom's story continues when bonded with flash thompson and becoming Agent Venom and working with Spider-Man and
        the Guardians of the Galaxy. In Amazing Spider Man #360 Venom reproduces and created a seperate symbiote known
        as Carnage. At another time some residual of a left over Venom fight made contact with Mr. Negative (A Spider
        Man villain) which cretaes a new symbiote known as Anti-Venom
      </p>

      <p>During the Venomverse comic series (a darker parallel to the spider-verse event) the readers are introduced to 
        several "venomized" characters. For example: Captain America, Black Panther, Deadpool, Wolverine. During this
        we are introduced to a celestial race known as the poisons who wish to assimilate the symbiote race.
        After a fight with the resistance the poisons are made aware of the multiverse leading to the venomverse event.
